My name is Ray Nicholus, and I'm a full-stack and front-end software engineer with 13 years of professional experience. I'm also the lead developer and product manager of [Fine Uploader](http://fineuploader.com/).
I like to write, blog, and [talk about software](http://slides.com/raynicholus)
in my free time. I've also recently written and published a web development book named [Beyond jQuery](https://amzn.com/1484222342).
